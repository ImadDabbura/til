The easiest way to clear a register; in norma mode, is `q-register_name-q`. The command `qa` will start recording a macro in the register `a`, which cleans the regoster before it starts the key strokes that follow. So when it is followed right away by `q`, it acts as clearing the register `a`.
This is very useful if we're trying to copy something to a register, such as copy all **TODO** from all project files into a register so that we can then past them in new file.
