# TIL

> Today I learned

In an effort to learn in public, this repo is a collection things that I learn day-to-day mainly in technology and languages.

The same `til` posts can also be found at my [website](https://imaddabbura.github.io/til.html) that looks much nicer and
easier to navigate and search.

Inspired by [Learn In Public](https://www.swyx.io/learn-in-public/) and [Josh Branchaud's TIL repo](https://github.com/jbranchaud/til).
